# quick_qeys

Custom python program that sort of mimics phrase express with deeper functionality. Can customize hotkeys to do things like fill out LTRR hotkey or launch common websites.

@Sam - Hopefully we can get some kind of GUI going on

@Ross - I don't know if python is on your roadmap. But if you want to work on a python project we could need the ability to customize hotkeys using the "keyboard" library. So a good internal API to interface with Sam's GUI will be helpful. Also we're gonna need a .exe to install this on agent's computers and add it to the startup programs to start at boot.
